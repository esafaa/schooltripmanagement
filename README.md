VISION:
As a parent, I've encountered difficulties with the field trip forms my kids' school sends each time they organize a field trip during the school year. I understand the importance of these trips in my children's development, and I don't want to miss any submission deadlines due to misplacing paper forms in my car or struggling to locate them.While teachers do send reminder emails, I also acknowledge that this process can be time-consuming for them.

SEQUENCE:

Teacher will create itself account on this app, then he will login with his account.

Then he will have an option to view existing trips, and another option to create new trip.

After select the create new trip option he will be creating a trip along with images. So he can view all the trips including the one he just created. He can then logout.

On the other hand when a parent will register and login,

He can see all the trips that will be there in the database, in front of each trip there will be a button to view attached files, and 1 button for approval of the trip.

After approval, that trip will be marked as approved for that specific parent.

Then teacher can open any trip and see which parent have approved the trip.
